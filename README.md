# machine-unlearning

Hello, this repository pertains to the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03817}{1st Machine Unlearning paper} and our replications of the results of the paper with the 
Purchase dataset, as well as additional testing done to further test the relationships between sharding, retraining times, and accuracy. 


The main code that was used to generate all the plots can be found in the .ipynb file, and all the csv files we used to generate the plots are in the CSVs folder. These 
files were generated by using the script the authors of the Machine Unlearning paper themselves created. There were some adjustments made to various portions of this script
when we started testing beyond the original example given by the authors. Most of these changes (number of shards, slices, etc.) can be adjusted with the shell files of the 
\href{https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/machine-unlearning}{code} from the paper.
